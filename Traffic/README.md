1. Project Instructions
	> Traffic Sign Classifier Project
	> In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Specifically, you'll train a model to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
	> Set Up Your Environment

	> _CarND Starter Kit_
	> Install the car nanodegree starter kit if you have not already done so: [carnd starter kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

	> _TensorFlow_
	> If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the TensorFlow instructions for [installing TensorFlow with GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#optional_install_cuda_gpus_on_linux).

	> Once you've installed all of the necessary dependencies, you can install the tensorflow-gpu package:
	```
	pip install tensorflow-gpu
	```
	> _Amazon Web Services_
	> Instead of a local GPU, you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money.)

	> * [Follow the Udacity instructions](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/edf28735-efc1-4b99-8fbb-ba9c432239c8/modules/6b6c37bc-13a5-47c7-88ed-eb1fce9789a0/lessons/f035a45d-6203-4947-8175-6095862204d3/concepts/f6fccba8-0009-4d05-9356-fae428b6efb4) to launch an EC2 GPU instance with the udacity-carnd AMI.
	> * Complete the Setup instructions.
