	> Distortion: Image distortion occurs when a camera looks at 3D objects in the real world and transforms them into a 2D image; this transformation isnâ€™t perfect. Distortion actually changes what the shape and size of these 3D objects appear to be. So, the first step in analyzing camera images, is to undo this distortion so that you can get correct and useful information out of them.
